# impress.md.js

impress.md.js is a JavaScript library to make impressive presentation by utilizing [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) in markdown style.

This source code is generated by [generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) that supports great features like minification and live reload in order to quickly and efficiently make great presentation.


## Motivations

This aims at making great presentation for audiences to easily understand its contents, not at making just flashy presentation.

For example, zoom-in and -out are very suitable representation to show an overview of something first and zoom in its details after the overview.
And 3D transition is nice representation for audiences to clearly understand 3D structure of something.

Such representation was impossible or quite tough to be made with traditional presentation tools.
Thanks to web technologies, it is easier to make effective representation and a new presentation tool for doing that.

It is important to create something new which web technologies can do, not to just mimic something which traditional technologies did.
